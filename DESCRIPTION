Description: Functions to generate incidence matrices and bipartite graphs that have (1) a fixed fill rate, (2) given marginal sums, (3) marginal sums that follow given distributions, or (4) represent bill sponsorships in the US Congress <doi:10.31219/osf.io/ectms>. It can also generate an incidence matrix from an adjacency matrix, or bipartite graph from a unipartite graph, via a social process mirroring team, group, or organization formation <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2204.13670>.
