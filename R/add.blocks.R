#' Adds a block structure to an incidence matrix
#'
#' `add.blocks` shuffles an incidence matrix to have a block structure or planted partition while preserving the row and column sums
#'
#' @param I matrix: An incidence matrix
#' @param blocks integer: number of blocks to add (between 2 and 26)
#' @param density numeric: desired within-block density
#' @param max.tries numeric: number of ineligible re-wiring attempts before giving up
#'
#' @details
#' Stochastic block and planted partition models generate graphs in which the probability that two nodes are connected
#'    depends on whether they are members of the same or different blocks/partitions. Functions such as \link[igraph]{sample_sbm}
#'    can randomly sample from stochastic block models with given probabilities. In contrast `add.blocks` attempts to
#'    generate a block model that preserves the degree sequences (i.e., a matrix with preserved row and column sums).
#' 
#' Each row and each column node are randomly assigned to one of `blocks` number of groups. Then
#'    checkerboard swaps are performed that increase the within-block density, until `density` is achieved.
#'    Eligible swaps are identified randomly, so the re-wiring can be slow when `I` is large. The process
#'    can get stuck when no eligible swaps remain but the target `density` has not been achieved; if this
#'    happens, increase `max.tries` to keep looking for eligible swaps or reduce the target `density`.
