\title{Adds a block structure to an incidence matrix}
\usage{
add.blocks(I, blocks = 2, density = 0.5, max.tries = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{I}{matrix: An incidence matrix}

\item{blocks}{integer: number of blocks to add (between 2 and 26)}

\item{density}{numeric: desired within-block density}

\item{max.tries}{numeric: number of ineligible re-wiring attempts before giving up}
}
\value{
matrix: An incidence matrix, row and column names begin with a letter indicating their block membership
}
\description{
\code{add.blocks} shuffles an incidence matrix to have a block structure while preserving the row and column sums
}
\details{
Each row and each column node are randomly assigned to one of \code{blocks} number of groups. Then
checkerboard swaps are performed that increase the within-block density, until \code{density} is achieved.
Eligible swaps are identified randomly, so the re-wiring can be slow when \code{I} is large. The process
can get stuck when no eligible swaps remain but the target \code{density} has not been achieved; if this
happens, increase \code{max.tries} to keep looking for eligible swaps or reduce the target \code{density}.

\examples{
I <- incidence.from.probability(R = 20, C = 20, P = .5)
I <- add.blocks(I, blocks = 2, density = .7)
