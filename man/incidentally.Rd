\title{incidentally: Generates incidence matrices and bipartite graphs}
\description{
Functions to generate incidence matrices and bipartite graphs that have (1) a fixed
fill rate, (2) given marginal sums, (3) marginal sums that follow given distributions, or (4)
are generated by a social process mirroring team, group, or organization formation.

Incidence matrices can be generated:
\itemize{
\item ...with a fixed fill rate: \code{\link[=incidence.from.probability]{incidence.from.probability()}}.
\item ...with given marginals: \code{\link[=incidence.from.vector]{incidence.from.vector()}}.
\item ...with marginals that follow given distributions: \code{\link[=incidence.from.distribution]{incidence.from.distribution()}}.
\item ...from a network, by a social process mirroring team, group, or organization formation \code{\link[=incidence.from.adjacency]{incidence.from.adjacency()}}.
}
